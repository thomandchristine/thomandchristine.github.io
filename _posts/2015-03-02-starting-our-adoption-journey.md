Cat’s out of the bag: we've begun the process of adopting a baby. It’s exciting and nerve wracking all at the same time. We have a long way to go, but the application is in. This week we have our first interview and, as our home repairs start to wind down and life returns to normal after the flood, we’ll have our home study. We don’t know what the future holds, but we’re excited for the journey and thankful for all of the love support we’re already getting from friends and family. Check back here for updates on our journey.
