##About Christine
![](/assets/images/christine.jpg#align-right) 

I was born and raised in Tulsa.  I've always been interested in art and learning new creative skills.  I have a degree in Interior Architecture & Design, but while I was in college, I started my own business selling my a line of homewares and artwork that I design and make.  That led me to organizing an indie craft show, which then led to me opening a retail shop of handmade goods in downtown Tulsa, so now I've turned those things into my daily work.  We also teach a lot of classes and host DIY and art workshops at our shop and in the community.  Working for myself is great because it allows me to make my own schedule, and I get to be at home with Thom most of the time.  We have a sweet little life and I can't wait to bring a little one into our home and spend my days sharing my love and creativity with a child.

##About Thom
![](/assets/images/thom.jpg#align-left) 

I grew up in Cypress, TX (northwest Houston) before coming to school in Tulsa. While working on my undergrad, I met Christine and fell in love with her and Tulsa, making it my home. I got my undergrad degree in English and Political Science and my Master’s in Theology. By day, I’m a digital marketer for a tech company in San Francisco which is great because I get to work from home. I’m also the subdeacon and youth director at St. Antony Orthodox Christian Church.  I love cooking, reading, movies, design, board games and studying history and theology, which I guess makes me kinda nerdy. Oh, and I have a borderline unhealthy obsession with Christmas.

##Our Story

We met in August of 2002 at a concert here in Tulsa through a mutual friend. We became fast friends, hanging out, watching movies, talking on the phone (back in the days before texting) and Thom would look for cheesey reasons to get together.

We were great for one another and within 6 months we were 
engaged to be married. Over the next year and 2 months, we spent as much time getting to know one another as we could, sharing our hopes and dreams and getting excited to start our lives together.

We were married in a small ceremony with our close friends and family on April 24, 2004 at St. Antony Orthodox Christian Church. It's been an amazing 11 years building home, adopting our dogs, and spending together making memories. We really are each other's best friends and are almost inseperable.
